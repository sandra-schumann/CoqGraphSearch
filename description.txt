Coq Graph Search: Project Description
=====================================

Team
----

Our team consists of Andres Erbsen and Sandra Schumann.

Modelling Goal
--------------

The modelling part for this project will consist of finding some way to
represent graphs (possibly trying out several and sorting out which one works
best for our goals). Th graphs being represented may be undirected or directed,
or possibly undirected graphs may be represented as a special case of directed
graphs.

The subsequent goal would be to implement one or several graph search
algorithms using the graph representation chosen.

* The minimum goal is to implement BFS.
* A good result would be to implement BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Extra credit, in case there is extra time: implement A*.

Goal for Proofs
---------------

This project aims to prove the "correctness" of (one or several) common graph
search algorithm(s). The definition of "correctness" must be carefully chosen
and for that reason this will not be written down here but instead chosen in
the process of working with the proofs. The general idea is that the
"correctness" definition chosen should ideally match closely what a human
being perceives as "correct" when talking about the algorithm(s) mentioned
above ("finds shortest path from node A to node B" or similar, only more
detailed).
